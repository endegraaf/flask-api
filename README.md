# flask-api
Simple Python Flask to make an Rest-API (fe) and MySQL (be)

## Purpose of this repo
So I was fooling around with Python and wanted to make a Rest-API as front-end that communicates with a backend database. 
No problemo you would say? Yes, on my local network this doesn't pose any challenge but you need to consider hosting, and setting it up properly, consider security, SSL certificates and all that good stuff. Didn't want to put a SQL server on the web. 
Came across eu.pythonanywhere.com and it fit my needs perfectly. 

# Installation 
- Python 3.x 
- install all required libraries from the ```requirements.txt```
- MySQL / MariaDB server is required for this to work.
